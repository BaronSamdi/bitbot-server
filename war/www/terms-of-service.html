<h5>WITNESSETH</h5>

Bitrule provides the Bitrule System to its end users as a tool to assist such end users in managing their trading in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and others, as well as to facilitate the transmission and receipt of trading related messages, including such messages as those that will be transmitted between User and a virtual currency exchange, a U.S. registered broker-dealer, futures commission merchant or other similar person properly authorized to effect transactions in virtual currencies  and other financial instruments; and</p>

<p>WHEREAS, User desires to, and Bitrule agrees to permit User to, and to authorize its Authorized Users to access and use the Bitrule System on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby agree as follows:</p>

<h5>AGREEMENT</h5>
<h6>ARTICLE I</h6>
<p><strong>LICENSE GRANT AND LIMITATIONS</strong></p>

<p><storng>1.1 Grant of License.</strong> Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Bitrule hereby grants User a personal, limited, royalty-free, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable and non-sublicenseable (except to Authorized Users in accordance with Section 1.2) right to, during the Term, (a) access and use the Bitrule System, (b) download and execute the Bitrule Software (including, the application programming interface (the "API")) and (c) modify the API as necessary to allow the Authorized Users to access and use the Bitrule System. User and its Authorized Users may use the Bitrule Software and Bitrule System solely in accordance with their then current documentation.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 Authorized Users.</strong>
<p>(a) Authorized Users. User may allow one or more of its Representatives specified by User to access the Bitrule System by providing such specified Representatives with a unique password and user identification combination (each, an "Access Method") provided or otherwise specified by Bitrule (such users, "Authorized Users"). User is solely responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Users have access to the Bitrule System and that Authorized Users access the Bitrule System using only the Access Method assigned to such user. In Bitrule's sole discretion, Bitrule may terminate, revoke, suspend, modify, or change any or all Access Methods assigned to User at any time with or without prior notice.</p>
<p>(b) Confidentiality of Access Methods. User shall, and shall cause each of its Authorized Users to, keep the Access Methods strictly confidential using at least the same degree of care that User uses to protect its own confidential information.</p>
<p>(c) Identification of Authorized Users. At Bitrule's request, User agrees to provide Bitrule with a complete list of User's current Authorized Users and their countries of domicile. User acknowledges that, in Bitrule's discretion, Bitrule may deny access to the Bitrule System to any of User's Authorized Users, at any time and for any reason.</p>
<p>(d) Security of Connection. User is solely responsible for ensuring the security of its and its Authorized Users' connection to the Bitrule System.</p>
<p>(e) Acts or Omissions of Authorized Users. User is and will be solely responsible for all acts or omissions of its Authorized Users and of any Person using the Bitrule System through its Access Methods. User will ensure all Authorized Users comply with all relevant terms of this Agreement and any failure to do so will constitute a breach by User. Without limitation of the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, User agrees to be bound by the terms of all Message Data entered and orders placed on or through the Bitrule System by its Authorized Users or using its Access Methods. All transmissions generated through use of its Access Methods will be deemed to be authorized by User and made by an Authorized User whether or not Bitrule acknowledges receipt of such transmission.</p>
<p>(f) Lost or Stolen Access Methods. In the event any Access Method assigned to User is lost, stolen or compromised, User agrees to promptly notify Bitrule. Bitrule will cancel any such lost, stolen or compromised Access Method as soon as practicable after receipt of notice from User. Notwithstanding the foregoing, User shall remain responsible for any actions taken through the use of such Access Method through the notice of cancellation.</p>

<p><strong>1.3 Appropriate Use.</strong></p>
<p>(a) User agrees to use the Bitrule System and send and receive Message Data only for its own benefit and account(s), and not to use the Bitrule System on behalf of third parties (other than its clients, if User is a broker-dealer, investment manager or investment adviser) without Bitrule's prior written consent.</p>
<p>(b) User agrees not to, and shall cause each of its Authorized Users not to, do any of the following without Bitrule's prior written consent: (i) use the Bitrule System or the Bitrule Software for any purposes other than as set forth herein; (ii) copy any portion of the Bitrule System or the Bitrule Software, except that User may make copies of such software as necessary for archival and disaster recovery purposes and as necessary for installation on the computers of Authorized Users; (iii) resell or otherwise distribute any of its Access Methods to any other party (other than Authorized Users as provided herein); (iv) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discern the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, software design and architecture or interface protocols of the Bitrule System, the Bitrule Software or any other software provided pursuant to this Agreement; (v) except with respect to the API, which may be modified as set forth in Section 1.1, modify, adapt, translate or reproduce the Bitrule System, the Bitrule Software, or any other software provided pursuant to this Agreement, merge any part of the Bitrule System or such software with or into other software, or create derivative works based upon the Bitrule System or such software; (vi) use the Bitrule System or Bitrule Software to operate in or as a time-sharing, outsourcing, or service bureau environment, or as an application service provider, or in any way allow others to use the Bitrule System or Bitrule Software for the benefit of any third party; or (vii) take or authorize any action that could detrimentally interfere with the proper workings of the Bitrule System, use any robot, spider or other device or process to monitor or copy the Bitrule System, or knowingly transmit any virus or other potentially harmful device in connection with use of the Bitrule System.</p>

<p><strong>1.4 User Responsibilities.</strong></p>

<p>User will be solely responsible for any losses, damages or costs that may be incurred as a result of errors made by, or the failure of, or delays caused by, the software or equipment that is used by User or any of its Authorized Users to access the Bitrule System. User's use of the Bitrule System is at User's own discretion and risk and User is solely responsible for any damage, servicing, repair or corrections to its computer systems or other devices, as well as any interruptions in business operations or loss of data that results from such use or inability to use the Bitrule System.</p>

<p><strong>1.5 Additional Terms of Use.</strong></p>

<p>Additional terms for use of the Bitrule System may be set forth in a separate supplement to this Agreement or on the Bitrule System user interface, or otherwise made available to User pursuant to Section 1.12, and User agrees to be bound by such additional terms.</p>

<p><strong>1.6 Applications.</strong></p>

<p>Bitrule may, from time to time, make available applications created by or on behalf of third parties, which can be used on or with the Bitrule System (the "Applications"). User acknowledges and agrees that the Applications are provided entirely "as-is" and that Bitrule makes no representations or warranties or assumes any liability regarding any such Applications that User may choose to purchase, download or otherwise access and User further agrees to comply with any additional restrictions on usage of such Applications that Bitrule or such third party may communicate to User from time to time, including any such restrictions that may be contained in any license agreement by and between User and such third party licensors.</p>

<p><strong>1.7 Limited Remote Support.</strong></p>

<p>Subject to Section 1.8, Bitrule agrees to provide reasonable technical support by electronic means or telephone with respect to User's connection to the Bitrule System and to use commercially reasonable efforts to remotely address issues independently encountered or identified by User in connection with its connection to or use of the Bitrule System.</p>

<p><strong>1.8 No Warranty.</strong></p>

<p>Bitrule does not warrant or guarantee that the Bitrule System or Bitrule Software will be uninterrupted or error-free or that the Bitrule System will meet the requirements of User or any Authorized User.</p>

<p><strong>1.9 Title to Bitrule System. </strong></p>

<p>All right, title and interest in and to the Bitrule System and Bitrule Software, including the concepts, specifications, interfaces and technology and other Intellectual Property inherent in the Bitrule System and Bitrule Software, are, and at all times shall remain, the sole and exclusive property of Bitrule or an Affiliate of Bitrule. Except for the limited right to use the Bitrule System and Bitrule Software, as set forth herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall directly or indirectly be construed to assign or grant to User or any Authorized Users any right, title or interest in and to the Intellectual Property of Bitrule or any Affiliate of Bitrule or any ownership rights in or to the Bitrule System and Bitrule Software. User agrees not to remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices that may be affixed to or contained within the Bitrule System, Bitrule Software, or any software or documentation provided in connection with this Agreement. User agrees to protect and not violate any proprietary rights of Bitrule or any Affiliate of Bitrule or those of its third party licensors or service providers and to honor and comply with Bitrule's reasonable requests to protect its, and any of Bitrule's Affiliates' and third party licensors' and service providers' contractual, statutory and common law rights in the Bitrule System, Bitrule Software, and any related software and documentation. If User becomes aware of any violation of the proprietary rights of Bitrule, any Affiliate of Bitrule, any third party licensors or service providers in the Bitrule System or Bitrule Software, User agrees to promptly notify Bitrule in writing.</p>

<p><strong>1.10 Export Control. </strong></p>

<p>The Bitrule Software may be subject to the export control laws of the United States and other countries. In particular, but without limitation, the Bitrule Software may not be exported, re-exported or provided (a) to any U.S. embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person's List or Entity List. User agrees to comply with all applicable export control laws, and User represents, warrants and covenants that none of User nor any of its Authorized Users is, or will be at any time during the Term, located in any restricted country or appear on any denied persons list.</p>

<p><strong>1.11 Electronic Communications. </strong></p>

<p>User hereby consents to the delivery of any required or optional communication under this Agreement or under any Applicable Law, including any changes in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, via the Bitrule System, by e-mail, website or other electronic means, subject to compliance with any Applicable Laws. Any such documents that are delivered electronically are deemed to be "in writing." If a signature or acknowledgment is required or requested with respect to any such document and any Authorized User "clicks" in the appropriate space, or takes such other action as may be indicated on the Bitrule System, User will be deemed to have signed or acknowledged the document to the same extent and with the same effect as if User had signed the document manually. User acknowledges that it has the right to withdraw its consent to the electronic delivery and signature of documents at any time by providing prior written notice to Bitrule. However, if User revokes its consent, its access to the Bitrule System may be restricted or terminated.

<p>E-mail, chat and instant messaging features may be provided as a convenience to enhance communications by and between Bitrule and User. User agrees to use these features in compliance with Applicable Law, and not to use them to transmit inappropriate information, including information that may be deemed obscene, libelous, harassing, fraudulent or slanderous.

<p>(a) Definition of "Force Majeure". "Force Majeure" means any action, event or occurrence outside the reasonable control of the party in question, including (i) action of the elements, riot, strike, other labor dispute, insurrection, terrorism, fire, severe weather, other act of God, shortages of materials, rationing, internet failure or other delay in receiving data, explosion, war, acts of public enemies, blockade, embargo, power failure and embargo or other action of any Governmental Authority (other than any action of a Governmental Authority directed specifically to the affected party); and (ii) the imposition of any new Applicable Law or the change of any Applicable Law (including the manner in which such laws are applied) making performance of any material obligation under this Agreement illegal or otherwise impossible; provided, that in the case of any action, event or occurrence described in the preceding clause (i) or (ii), such action, event or occurrence: (A) is beyond the reasonable control of the party claiming relief under this Section 7.1 and cannot or could not, despite the exercise of reasonable diligence, be or have been prevented, avoided or removed by such party; (B) materially adversely affects the ability of the affected party to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and the affected party has taken all reasonable precautions, due care and reasonable alternative measures to avoid the effect of such event on the affected party's ability to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and to mitigate the consequences thereof; and (C) is not the result of any failure of the affected party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.
(b) Effect of Force Majeure. No party shall be considered to be in default of any of its representations and warranties under this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeure, or in breach of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent (but only to the extent) that performance of such obligations is prevented by any circumstances of Force Majeure; provided, that notice of such occurrence is given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.1 and the party whose performance is adversely affected uses commercially reasonable efforts to promptly overcome or mitigate the effects of such Force Majeure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 7.1 shall be without limitation on a party's obligations under this Agreement with respect to disaster recovery, redundancy and business continuity. In the event of a Force Majeure, the parties agree to consult in good faith with respect to any commercially reasonable measures that may be taken in order to mitigate the impact of such Force Majeure.
(c) Notice of Force Majeure. Promptly upon becoming aware of any occurrence of an event of Force Majeure, the party affected by such event of Force Majeure shall notify the other party and provide documentary proof (if any) of the existence of an event of Force Majeure, and such notice and proof shall include (i) the particulars of the event giving rise to such Force Majeure claim, in as much detail as is then reasonably available, (ii) its current estimate of the extent to which, and the period during which, the performance of such party will be affected by such event of Force Majeure, and (iii) the particulars of the program to be implemented to ensure prompt and full resumption of such party's normal performance under this Agreement. Upon removal of an event of Force Majeure, the affected party shall give notice to the other party and re-commence its performance of its affected obligations under this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
